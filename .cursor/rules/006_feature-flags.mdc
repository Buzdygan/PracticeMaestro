## Feature Flags

Implement feature flags to manage the rollout of new features. Use a centralized configuration to toggle features on or off.

### Features to Flag

- `fragmentPractice`: Enables practice of specific fragments within pieces.
- `adaptiveTempo`: Suggests tempo adjustments based on user performance.
- `taggingGoals`: Allows tagging of practice items and setting goals.

**Default State**: All new features should be set to `false` by default and enabled progressively.
