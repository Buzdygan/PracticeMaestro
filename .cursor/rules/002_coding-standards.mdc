## Coding Standards

- **TypeScript**: Enable strict mode with settings like `noImplicitAny`, `strictFunctionTypes`, and `noUnusedLocals`.
- **Linting**: Use ESLint with recommended settings and TypeScript plugin. Enforce rules such as:
  - No usage of `any` type.
  - Consistent use of single quotes.
- **Formatting**: Utilize Prettier with a print width of 80, single quotes, and trailing commas where valid in ES5.
- **Component Structure**: Prefer functional components with clearly defined prop interfaces.
- **Styling**: Apply Tailwind CSS classes; avoid inline styles and CSS-in-JS solutions.
